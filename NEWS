	After the monolithic Bypass library began to evolve at its natural pace,
	it became apparent that three distinct modules existed. One dedicated to
	each platform (Android and iOS) and the shared core. The core code was
	extracted and now consists of Natacha Kerensikova's markdown parser,
	libsoldout, and Uncodin's code that takes the result of parsing and forms
	an intermediary tree structure.
